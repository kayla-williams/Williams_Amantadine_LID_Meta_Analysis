# Overview

This repository provides the R code for the manuscript titled "A meta-analysis of the long-term efficacy of Amantadine for Levodopa-induced dyskinesia in Parkinson’s Disease", authored by Williams, K., Curtis, M. A., Gombinsky, L., and Parmar, P.
The code was developed to be specific to the analyses conducted in the above manuscript and is not intended for use in any other context. Each script is specific to one of the Parkinson’s Disease motor outcomes of the analysis, including: the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) or Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) Part III, IV, IVa; the Unified Dyskinesia Rating Scale (UDysRS); “ON” time in hours; and “OFF” time in hours. The script contains code for all time-points (“up to 13 weeks”, “up to 16 weeks”, “12 to 16 weeks” and “38 to 101 weeks”) for the given outcome. There is also a separate script for the sensitivity analyses performed for UPDRS IV at “up to 16 weeks”.
